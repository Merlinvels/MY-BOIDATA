<h2>PROJECTS</h2>
<b><h3>UG PROJECT</b></h3>
<b><h3><u>MACHINE CONDITION MONITORING FOR ROTARY COMPRESSOR</b></h3></u>
This project has been done at BHEL, Trichy.

It is a PLC based application which serves two processes.
<pre>The system monitors the compressors working condition; it consists of both vibration sensor and temperature sensor. Here the PLC gives alarm to the user when an abnormal condition occurred in the working compressor.The system automatically shutdowns the compressor when the user does not attend the fault.

<b>DIPLOMA PROJECT:</b>

<b><u>GESTURE BASED DC MOTOR SPEED CONTROL</b></u>

This project is developed for the user to control the operation of a DC motor using Microcontroller PIC16F73.
This project uses 4 IR sensor for the operation or DC motor. These four sensor are responsible for start,stop ,speed up and speed down. According to the IR sensor output microcontroller generates the control signal. The microcontroller controls the driver section for the corresponding operation of the motor and thus the motor runs accordingly. The gesture recognition is achieved using IR sensor.
The user can control the speed of the DC motor in an efficient manner. The microcontroller program is written in assembly language.

<h2><b>EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES:</h2></b>

Attended 1 National Conferences conducted by various colleges like LOARD JEGANATH college of Engineering and Technology, Kanyakumari District, UNIVERSAL college of Engineering,
Attended 2 National Conferences conducted by KALAIVANAR N.S.K. college of Engineering.
Attended number of National Level Technical Symposium, and participated in events like Paper Presentation, Poster Presentation and Quiz.
Won first prize for Poster Presentation conducted by Arunachala College of Engineering for women’s, Kanyakumari Dist., for the title “BLUE EYE TECHNOLOGY”.
